The indoor location data was taken using a sensor called bspoon. The user wore a bluetooth tag on her pocket and receivers were installed on the ceiling so that the position is calculated using  triangulation.

The log has three coordinates on each line X, Y Z given in meters.
The Z coordinate doesn't give much information but if it gives you more than 2.5 or it is negative, then the values (X and Y) are not very fiable.

The value 0,0,0 corresponds to the coin behind the television (refer to apartment plan).
X value measures the distance from that coin in direction to the main entrance.  Its maximum value is 10 meters.

Y value measure the distance perpendicular to Y, so from the coin to where the windows are Its maximum value is 5 meteres.
For example, given a coordinate of  8  4 1.5 corresponds more or less to being in the kitchen.
